    				<h2 class="mb-2 text-center">Our Goal</h2>
    				<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) found that women with disabilities still continue to face prejudice and discrimination daily. This has negatively affected their access to sexual and reproductive health services. The negative attitudes of health care providers made it difficult for women with disabilities to access sexual and reproductive health services.

    				<h2 class="mb-4">Why Need this Project?</h2>
    				<p> 
					Mimijean Foundation desires to take urgent advocacy to all government and private health workers on the need for creating equal reproductive health right to women and children living with disabilities.
					In 2018 the Foundation has lost three deaf women as a result of their inability to communicate with their doctors and lack of the presence of sign language interpreters in the
					hospitals and wheel chair users who cannot access the hospital facilities due to structural barriers. This situation was unanticipated because reproductive health right was presumed free and available to all women.

A recent baseline survey by the organization showed that women with disabilities (WWD) experience physical violence such as slapping, beating, arm twisting, stabbing, choking, kicking, and the like, at the hands of intimate partners mostly. The survey said WWD were much more likely than other women to experience physical abuse: sexual abuse, rape, violation of privacy, forced isolation, deprivation of liberty and so on. It further said that most WWD perpetually hide their experiences of violence due to fear of blame, increased stigma and verbal abuse when such cases are reported as well as the multiple harriers they face in accessing sexual and reproductive health, psychosocial and criminal justice services. According to the findings, these barriers subject them to living a life of low self-esteem characterized by severe psychological problems. The focus of the project is reaching out to religious leaders, traditional leaders and other stakeholders who have influence in society. Women with disabilities will often say that the first person they want to report to when  been violated or abused is their religious leaders. So one of the things this project is doing is to target religious leaders and traditional leaders as well as women and girls with disabilities including the men with disabilities to educate them on the insidious nature of violence against women with disabilities as it is happening in Nigeria and seek ways for them to understand that it is a serious issue and to being able to identify and report when it happens.

				<li>
				<strong><b>WHILE HIV/AIDS PANDEMIC IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN SRH, PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE MORE PRONE TO HIV INFECTION:</b></strong> This is due to several factors that include poverty and social exclusion where most of PWDs are not able to earn a living or access information due to social and environmental factors (South African National Council, 2008). Women with disabilities are more affected due to the gender disparity on HIV infection. It is evident in the general population that women are more susceptible to HIV infection hence women with disabilities 
				are even more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Women are more susceptible to HIV/AIDS infection, and “the lack of education and training on HIV/AIDS prevention, as well as lack of access to means of prevention are significant factors contributing to the growing incidences of HIV/AIDS among women” (CRR, 2006: 70). In addition, PWDs in general face more rampant sexual violence and the disability often hinders them from reporting the cases due to communication breakdown and social stigma (South African National AIDS Council, 2008).</li><li>
<strong><b>DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS OF SERVICES TO WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES:</b></strong> Due to lack of funding, the health care facilities in Nigeria 
introduced a two-tiered health care system where there is ‘private’ wing within the public health facilities. The women who cannot afford this are therefore discriminated against as they face delays in access to services. Many women, therefore, did not seek some of the services that are necessary for them like prenatal health checkups hence problems that could have easily been addressed became more life-threatening. While medical procedures in some of the hospitals indicated that the fees should be demanded after the women had been attended, the report notes that often the money was required before admission. Women “described being harassed or forbidden from entering hospitals, including public facilities like Psychiatric and mental health, if they did not have enough money to pay the deposit or fees.
</li><li><strong><b>PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE:</b></strong> WWD interviewed reported physical and verbal abuse from the health professionals attending to them during child birth and abuse relating to the medical procedures this included being stitched when ‘the anesthesia had already worn off. The findings of the report indicate that there, has been a persistent gross violation of women before, during and after delivery including neglect. Physical abuse was established o be rampant during labor and delivery. These are the challenges that women with disabilities face in accessing SRH services as was established by the research findings. There are barely friendly physical facilities to ensure their access, e.g. VCT centers in buildings that do not have lifts to access; the beds in maternity wards arc normally very high making it difficult for pregnant women with disabilities to access among others. The policies also fail, to put measures in place to ensure they also access the SRH. This includes the language used where Braille and sign language are not understood by the service providers. Some of the issues that the respondent raised that reflected personnel attitude towards women with disabilities included the use of derogatory language and delay in attending to the WWD. One respondent shared that she witnessed a physically disabled woman give birth on the floor. She could not get into the delivery bed due to the height, and the nurses declined to help her. The respondents explained that in some instances, the medical personnel assumed that women with disabilities are not supposed to be sexually active. One of the respondents sought medical treatment due to a condition that was later discovered to be STI, but took long for her to be diagnosed.” When he (the doctor) was giving me possible causes for my abdominal pains, he made it obvious that in my case it couldn’t be an STI as I’m probably sexually inactive”. In another incident, when a disabled woman went to seek VCT services, the attending counselor asked her (“even you, are sexually active”!).
</li></ul>
<strong><b>THE URGENT ACTION</b></strong>

To contribute and enhance the quality sexual and reproductive life of marginalized Women and lecture them on steps to improve their living condition. The overall objectives of the project are:

To provide training and lectures on capacity building to enable WWD discover their fundamental rights.
To provide an avenue where Counsellors can interact with WWD, discover their challenges and guide them o available options that are void of suicide and depression.
To provide them with technical, administrative and logistical support and promote good health and awareness, get them tested and also make available necessary equipments.
